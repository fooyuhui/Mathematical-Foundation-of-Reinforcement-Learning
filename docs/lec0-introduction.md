# Introduciton

## Why this course?

Books (computer science perspective):

* R.S Sutton and A.G.Barto, Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT Press, 1998/2008. 强化学习领域的圣经，但未必适合入门，文字性描述比较多
* C. Szepesvari, Algorithms for Reinforcement learning. Morgan and Claypool Publishers, 2010. 一本短小精悍的小册子

Features of reinforcement learning:

* Mathematical
* Systematic

Let math talk: Math $\Rightarrow$ Intution, but Intution $\nRightarrow$ Math

This course introduces RL topics from a mathematical point of view. There are many instructive examples.

For this course, you need: You want to understand the RL topics thoroughly, not just programming.
